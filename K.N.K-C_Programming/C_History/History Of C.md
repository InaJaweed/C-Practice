# History of C
## Origins
- C was developed as a by-product of the development of the Unix operating system at Bell Laboratories.
- Key developers were Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others.
- Unix was initially developed on a DEC PDP-7 computer, an early minicomputer with only 8K words of main memory in 1969.
### Predecessor to C:
- UNIX was originally written in assembly language.
- Thompson created a lagnuage called B, based on BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language).
- B was used for further development of UNIX.
### Development of C:
- Dennis Ritchie began developing C as an extension of B around 1970s.
- Dennis Ritchie initially called it "New B" or  "NB".
- The language was eventually renamed to C.
### Adoption of C:
- By 1973, UNIX was rewritten in C.
- This switch to C provided significant advantages for UNIX development.
- Allowed UNIX to be more portable across different architectures.
## Standardisation
- The first edition of "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie, was published in 1978.
- This book became the de facto standard for C programming.
- C expanded beyond UNIX systems to various machines and operating systems.
- Gained popularity on the IBM PC platforms.
- As C became more popular, problems arose due to inconsistencies in compiler implementations.
- The K&R book was unclear on some language features.
- In 1983, development of a U.S. standard for C began under ANSI (American National Standards Institute).
- The standard was completed in 1988 and approved in 1989 as ANSI X3.159-1989.
- It became an international standard (ISO/IEC 9899:1990) in 1990, known as C89 or C90.
- In 1995, some changes were made (Amendment 1).
- A new standard, C99, was published in 1999.
- The term "ANSI C", "ANSI/ISO C", and "ISO C" once used to describe C89 became ambiguous due to multiple standards.
## C-Based Languages
- C++ adds object-oriented features to C.
- Java is based on C++ and inherits many features from C.
- C# is derived from C++ and Java.
- Perl has adopted many C features over time.
## Learning C
- C is a powerful language with a simple syntax.
- Provides fundamental concepts that are used in many other languages.
